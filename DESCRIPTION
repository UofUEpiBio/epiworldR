Description: A flexible framework for Agent-Based Models (ABM), the 'epiworldR' package provides methods for prototyping disease outbreaks and transmission models using a 'C++' backend, making it very fast. It supports multiple epidemiological models, including the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS), Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR), Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR), and others, involving arbitrary mitigation policies and multiple-disease models. Users can specify infectiousness/susceptibility rates as a function of agents' features, providing great complexity for the model dynamics. Furthermore, 'epiworldR' is ideal for simulation studies featuring large populations.
