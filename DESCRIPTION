Description: A flexible framework for Agent-Based Models (ABM), the epiworldR
  package provides a fast method for prototyping disease outbreaks and 
  transmission models. It supports multiple epidemiological models like the 
  Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS,) Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR,) 
  Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR,) and others, involving arbitrary 
  mitigation policies and multiple-disease models. Users can specify 
  infectiousness/susceptibility rates as a function of agents' features, 
  providing great complexity for the model dynamics. epiworldR uses a C++ 
  backend, which makes it very fast. Furthermore, epiworldR is ideal for 
  simulation studies featuring large populations.
