Description: A specialized collection of measles epidemiological models built on the 'epiworldR' framework. This package is a spinoff from 'epiworldR' focusing specifically on measles transmission dynamics. It includes models for school settings with quarantine and isolation policies, mixing models with population groups, and risk-based quarantine strategies. The models use Agent-Based Models (ABM) with a fast 'C++' backend from the 'epiworld' library. Ideal for studying measles outbreaks, vaccination strategies, and intervention policies.
