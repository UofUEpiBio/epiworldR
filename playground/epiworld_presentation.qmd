## Overview

Epiworld is a coding package created for the sole purpose of simulating infectious diseases as they spread through populations. The user is able to specify certain parameters in order to replicate real-world conditions such as population size, vaccination rates, hospitalization rates, schools as entities, and of course, the disease of interest.

Epiworld contains several epidemiological models in which the user may select to run such a simulation. These models include: SIR, SIS, SEIR, and Surveillance.

## Main Features

## Feature 1: C++ Header only template library

## Feature 3: Calibration done via Likelihood-free MCMC

## Feature 4: From very simple to highly-complex models

## Agent-Based Modeling

-   Epiworld simulates the interactions of autonomous agents (people).

-   The ability to analyze the effects of diseases like COVID and the Flu on human populations can be done in mere seconds.

-   Specific parameters reflecting real-life human interactions can be set.

## Epiworld Models

#### Currently Supported (More models to come):

1.  SIR - Susceptible - Infected - Recovered

2.  SIRCONNECTED - SIR model with the assumption that all agents are connected to each other

3.  SIS - Susceptible - Infected - Susceptible

4.  SEIR - Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Removed

5.  SEIRCONNECTED - SEIR model with the assumption that all agents are connected to each other

6.  Surveillance - Models the effect of surveillance programs in a population

## Simulation Parameters

Model to use: SEIR

Disease of interest: COVID-19

Initial population size: 200,000 (Salt Lake City)

Vaccination rate: tbd

Hospitalization rate: tbd

Schools as entities: tbd

## Simulation

```{r}
library(epiworldR)
seir <- ModelSEIR(name = "COVID-19", prevalence = 0.01, infectiousness = 0.9, incubation_days = 4, recovery = 0.3)

# Adding a Small world population
agents_smallworld(
  seir,
  n = 200000,
  k = 5,
  d = FALSE,
  p = .01
)

# Running and printing
run(seir, ndays = 100, seed = 1912)
seir
```

## Visualization

```{r}
x <- get_hist_total(seir)
x$counts <- x$counts / 1000
x <- x[x$date < 50, ]

with(
  x[x$status == "Susceptible", ],
  plot(
    x = date, y = counts, type = "l", col = "blue", ylim = range(x$counts),
    ylab = "Population (thousands)", xlab = "days", main = "SEIR model")
)

with(
  x[x$status == "Exposed", ],
  lines(x = date, y = counts, col = "purple")
)

with(
  x[x$status == "Infected", ],
  lines(x = date, y = counts, col = "red")
)

with(
  x[x$status == "Removed", ],
  lines(x = date, y = counts, col = "darkgreen")
)

legend(
  "right",
  legend = c("Susceptible", "Exposed", "Infected", "Removed"),
  col    = c("blue", "purple", "red", "darkgreen"),
  lty    = 1,
  lwd    = 2,
  bty    = "n"
)
```
