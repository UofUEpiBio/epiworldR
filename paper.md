# Introduction

Agent-based modeling (ABM) has emerged as a powerful computational approach to studying complex systems across various fields, including social sciences and epidemiology. By simulating the interactions and behaviors of individual entities, known as agents, ABM provides a unique lens through which researchers can analyze and understand the emergent properties and dynamics of these systems. The `epiworldR` package provides a flexible framework for ABM implementation and methods for prototyping disease outbreaks and transmission models using a C++ backend. It supports multiple epidemiological models, including the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS), Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR), Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR), and others, involving arbitrary mitigation policies and multiple-disease models. Users can specify transmission/susceptibility rates as a function of agents' features, providing great complexity for the model dynamics.

# Key Features

Built on the robust foundation of C++, this package combines efficient computation with the flexibility of R, providing a seamless user experience with several standout features:

-   Multiple Viruses - This feature allows researchers to simulate and analyze the dynamics of various infectious diseases simultaneously.
-   Multiple Tools - This capability enables users to design model objects that may reflect real-world interventions. Examples include vaccines, mask wearing protocols, social distancing, and much more.
-   Multiple Runs - `epiworldR` has the ability to run simulations multiple times, providing a more complete picture of simulation results and its behaviors.
-   Global Actions - Similar to adding multiple tools, global actions allow users to implement interventions and policies at a global scale at any point during a simulation, mimicking real-world scenarios and aiding in the assessment of their impact.
-   Built-In Epidemiological Models - This feature ensures that researchers have access to well-established and widely recognized frameworks, making it easier to compare and benchmark their results. Included are popular epidemiological models such as: SIR, SIS, SEIR, SIR connected, SIS connected, SEIR connected, and more.

With its extensive range of features, `epiworldR` empowers researchers and practitioners in the field of epidemiology to conduct thorough analyses, make informed decisions, and contribute to the advancement of public health.
